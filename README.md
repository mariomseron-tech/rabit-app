# Rabit App

A Next.js App Router starter configured for Rabit Digital with strict TypeScript, linting, formatting, and testing defaults.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run tests (Vitest + React Testing Library):

```bash
npm test
```

Lint and format:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint-staged
```

Husky hooks are installed automatically via the `prepare` script to run `lint-staged` on every commit.
